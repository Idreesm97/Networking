Folder contains the client and server with client graphical user interface and server graphical user interface. By Idrees Malik

About my folder
My zip folder contains two solutions, location and locationserver, and this readme file. These have been created to search for the location of users based of their username input.
The server and the client handles the protocols of the whois and HTTP protocols and the graphical user interface have been created for ease and simplified use.

Debugging:

To get to the server executable (locationserver.exe) which the directory of it is: G:\UltimateNetworkingFolder\locationserver\locationserver\bin\Debug

To get to the client executable(location.exe) which the directory of it is: G:\UltimateNetworkingFolder\Location\Location\bin\Debug

My location source code contains a capital 'L' for location meaning its 'Location', but I believe the capital L in location shouldn't affect anything.
